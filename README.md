Small project that keeps getting a bigger and bigger scope because I like adding more ideas more than implementing them
So the original idea was to make a generall purpose faction creator for classic fantays ttrpg systems that can directly be intigrated into Obsidian. That part works, kinda the logical consitency needs a makeover but it works. Now I moved on to populating the factions with people. These race options are oriented around the pf2e system but I am taking liberties in making it fit better for my own game world, but still HIGHLY wip. I migrated everything into JSON files so if someone wants to use this and put ther own spin on stuff it is easily edited without any coding knowledge. as soon as this is not as violently wip anymore I will make an exe and appdata file.

the worst thing about writing todo's is you have to do them after
current todo
  - include the base pf2e values
  - finish the logic for people
  - move more stuff into jsons DONE
  - make a sucsession system
  - migrate things to be static instead of just using a runner object Sidesteped the issue by making alibirary class
  - make a gui
  - reduce the stuff I just bomb into ram, like seriously I need to stop that send help
  - unify the organizations, I have three implementations that do the same thing atm, need to fix that
  - add more logical consitency (THIS the scary one)



also I should mention a lot of the JSON files I have are made with the help of Gemini and ChatGPT
