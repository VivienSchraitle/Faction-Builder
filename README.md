Small project that keeps getting a bigger and bigger scope because I like adding more ideas more than implementing them

current todo
  - include the base pf2e values
  - finish the logic for people
  - move more stuff into jsons
  - make a sucsession system
  - migrate things to be static instead of just using a runner object
  - make a gui
